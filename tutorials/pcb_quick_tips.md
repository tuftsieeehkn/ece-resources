# Quick tips on PCB Design

Printed circuit board (PCB) design is typically learned through projects and online tutorials, rather than taught in official electronics courses. 

Indeed, Altium Designer is a good software to learn, as it is popular in industry and offers a free license to students.

Start by creating a simple 2 layer PCB for blinking LEDs. A good starting point is to follow a YouTube tutorial, such as this [one](https://youtu.be/6N2A6LtBWh0?si=OE2v4KO5MxEQe8NG)

After getting the PCB fabricated through a manufacturer like JLCPCB or PCBWay, then assembled by soldering the parts onto the board, you will have completed your first PCB. Depending on your pace, at first it may take 10-20 hours to complete this simple PCB design, but through practice, you will quicken your speed and confidence on designing more sophisticated PCBs.

MIT also has a short class targeted towards this topic called [The Art and Science of PCB Design](https://pcb.mit.edu/) that provides resources to get started with designing a board.
